# 🔒 TEMPLATE PROTECTION

This file marks Mastermind as a TEMPLATE ENGINE.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: DO NOT MODIFY MASTERMIND DIRECTLY

Mastermind is designed to be:
✅ COPIED - Clone for new template variations
✅ SPAWNED FROM - Generate new repos from this template
✅ VERSIONED - Update carefully with semantic versions

❌ NOT a working repository
❌ NOT meant to be built into
❌ NOT for direct service implementation

## Philosophy

Mastermind spawns perfect, independent repos.
Each generated repo is self-contained and never calls back.

## To Use Mastermind:

1. Run: pnpm ai:new-service <name> --template=<type>
2. New repo is created (independent, production-ready)
3. Mastermind remains pristine for next generation

## To Enhance Mastermind:

1. Create feature branch
2. Add new template variations
3. Improve generation logic
4. PR to main with version bump
5. Never add service-specific code here

## Version: 1.0.0
