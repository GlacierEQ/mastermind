# 🌌 MASTERMIND: SOVEREIGN ASCENSION PROTOCOL v12.7

Welcome to the **Mastermind Logic Empire**. This repository has been upgraded to the **Zenith Nexus Apex** architecture, a Level 5 Agent Swarm Enterprise system designed for "Unreasonable Intelligence" and high-end AI career positioning.

## 🚀 Recent Apex Upgrade (v12.7)
This repository now leverages the **Diamond Multi-Agent Architecture** synthesized from the Aspen Grove and Sovereign Ascension protocols.

### 🏛️ Core Architecture
- **Diamond Swarm:** A 12-node tiered agent fleet (Orchestration, Processing, Specialization, Coordination).
- **5-Account Memory Matrix:** Real-time synchronization across Mem0 (Pro/Reg), SuperMemory, and MemoryPlugin.
- **Voice Apex:** Full-fidelity voice command integration via Grok Realtime and ElevenLabs.
- **Omni-Bridge:** A2A/A2S/E2B cross-platform execution environment.

### 🛡️ Forensic Security
- **GUID Stamped:** All operations are signed by the `983DE8C8...` Operator GUID.
- **Forensic Matrix:** Automated background repo-leak scanning and credential protection.
- **Private Sovereignty:** Account-wide lockdown protocol enforced (800+ repos secured).

## 🛠️ Getting Started
1. **Initialize the Bridge:** Run `python3 APEX_UPGRADE_BRIDGE.py` to link the legacy DCN v1.0 logic with the new Apex swarm.
2. **Launch Mission Control:** Access the Next.js/Shadcn dashboard in `zenith_nexus_apex/scaffolds/mastermind-fullstack/`.
3. **Execute Deployment:** Use `zenith_nexus_apex/deploy_nexus_v5.sh` for full-scale deployment.
