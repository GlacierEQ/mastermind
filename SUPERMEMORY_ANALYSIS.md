## SUPERMEMORY CAPABILITIES

### 4 Available Tools

1. **addMemory** - Save information persistently
   - Parameter: `thingToRemember` (string)
   - Optional: `projectId` (container tag)
   - Use: Capture evidence, testimony, timeline events

2. **search** - Semantic search across all memories
   - Parameter: `informationToGet` (string)
   - Optional: `projectId` (filter to specific project)
   - Use: Retrieve related facts, patterns, connections

3. **getProjects** - List all available containers
   - Returns: All 31 projects with containerTag mappings
   - Use: Browse available categories

4. **whoAmI** - Current user context
   - Returns: User identity and email
   - Result: OPERATOR (glacier.equilibrium@gmail.com)

## CURRENT FINDINGS

### System Status
✅ User authenticated (OPERATOR)
✅ 31 projects created and structured  
✅ Projects organized by case/domain  
⏳ Projects appear empty in search results (data visibility issue)

### Data Assessment
- **Search Issue:** Projects exist but semantic search returning empty
- **Likely Cause:** Data stored but not yet indexed in semantic layer
- **Solution:** Test addMemory to verify write/index pipeline works

---

## COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS: ALL THREE SYSTEMS

### Supermemory (ACTIVE)
- **Persistence:** Universal across all AI tools
- **Structure:** 31 organized projects
- **Search:** Semantic + exact matching
- **Best For:** Cross-session context, long-term storage

### Mem0 (OAuth Pending)
- **Persistence:** Session + episodic memory layers
- **Tools:** 9 methods (add, search, get, update, delete, list entities)
- **Features:** Multi-tenant (users, agents, apps, runs)
- **Best For:** Real-time learning, agent coordination

### Neo4j Graph (Available)
- **Persistence:** Knowledge graph with relationships
- **Features:** Entity connections, pattern discovery
- **Search:** Graph traversal + semantic
- **Best For:** Systemic correlation, institutional mapping

---

## RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (Next 30 min)
1. Test Supermemory `addMemory` write capability
2. Populate Kekoa TRO project with 5-10 key facts
3. Re-run search to verify indexing pipeline

### Short-term (This week)
1. Authenticate Mem0 (if OAuth available)
2. Create N8N sync workflow (Supermemory ↔ Mem0)
3. Add 25+ memories across cases

### Medium-term (Next week)
1. Activate Neo4j for Judge Naso relationship mapping
2. Build institutional corruption graph
3. Create predictive timeline models

## STATUS SUMMARY

**Triple Memory Architecture Ready:**
- Supermemory: Structure verified, data pipeline to test
- Mem0: Standing by (OAuth auth needed)  
- Neo4j: Available for deployment

**Kekoa TRO Case:**
31-project system ready to ingest 250+ facts currently stored in:
- GitHub SUPERLUMINAL_CASE_MATRIX
- Google Drive vault (10TB backup)
- Local documentation

**Next Action:** Begin populating Supermemory with case data (5-minute write test)
