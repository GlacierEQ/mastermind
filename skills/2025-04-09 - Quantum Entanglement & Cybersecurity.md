>> **Question:** What are the implications of quantum entanglement on the development of ultra-secure communication systems in the context of international cybersecurity policies?
>> 
>> **Answer:** Quantum entanglement allows for the creation of quantum key distribution (QKD) systems, where encryption keys are shared using entangled particles. This makes interception virtually impossible without detection, offering a new frontier in secure communication. In the realm of international cybersecurity, it compels the reevaluation of encryption standards, raises concerns over espionage-proof channels, and necessitates cooperative treaties to prevent an imbalance in quantum tech capabilities among nations.
