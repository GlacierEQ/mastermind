# 🌌 Omni Engine

The core intelligence and automation framework. This repository contains a comprehensive suite of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, specialized skills, and autonomous agents designed for end-to-end project execution.

## 🗂️ System Architecture

### 1. Skills Framework (`/skills`)
Modular automation units for specific domains:
- **Repo Operator**: Advanced repository analysis, patch generation, and deployment.
- **AI Autonomous Repair**: Self-healing code systems using LLM diagnostics.
- **Forensics**: Metadata and deep-file analysis for PDFs and binaries.
- **Connectivity Hub**: Unified interface for external API integrations (vLex, etc).
- **Mastermind**: High-level agent orchestration and auditing.

### 2. MCP Servers (78 Connected)
Fully integrated Model Context Protocol servers providing real-time access to:
- **Productivity**: Google Workspace, Notion, Slack, Linear.
- **Infrastructure**: Supabase, MongoDB, GitHub, Bitbucket.
- **Intelligence**: Perplexity, Exa, Brave Search, Gemini.

### 3. CLI Orchestration
- `skills-enhanced.py`: The primary entry point for executing complex multi-skill workflows.
- `apex_orchestrator.py`: System health monitoring and completion reporting.
