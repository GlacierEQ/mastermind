## 📋 MOTION TO STAY PROCEEDINGS AND ENFORCE PARENTAL RIGHTS

**Relief Sought**: Respondent [Casey] hereby moves for an immediate Stay of all current proceedings, including enforcement of any expired or procedural Temporary Restraining Orders (TROs), pending the resolution of fundamental procedural errors and the evaluation of parental alienation tactics.

### I. LEGAL BASIS
1. **HRS § 571-46**: Best interest of the child. The current procedural delays and lack of response to filed motions (30+ days) are causing direct harm to the child’s stability and well-being.
2. **HFCR Rule 93 & 94(a)**: Procedural compliance and mediator/evaluator orders.
3. **Writ of Mandamus Basis**: The Court has failed to act on multiple pending motions for over 30 days, violating the Respondent’s right to a timely hearing and due process.
4. **Pattern of Misconduct**: Evidence of fabricated allegations used to secure and extend TROs beyond their lawful application.

### II. SUPPORTING FACTS (Extracted via APEX Engine)
- **Fact 1**: Respondent has had only 0.6% weekly contact with the child despite no evidence of wrongdoing.
- **Fact 2**: Multiple motions have been filed with zero response from the Court for 30+ days.
- **Fact 3**: Opposing counsel [Brower] has engaged in a pattern of delay and inflammatory claims (ODC Complaint Ref: 1FDV-23-0001009-Brower).
- **Fact 4**: PACT visitation records show a pattern of cooperation from Respondent that has been ignored by the Court.

### III. PROPOSED ORDER
The Respondent requests the Court to:
- Stay all enforcement actions pending a comprehensive review of the case timeline.
- Order a Neutral Evaluator under HFCR 93 to address alienation concerns.
- Require Opposing Counsel to respond to all outstanding motions within 10 days.
