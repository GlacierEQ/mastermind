# 📑 Omni_Engine Technical Specifications

## 🧬 Quantum Context Compression
- **Mechanism**: Implements semantic pruning of non-essential conversation history.
- **Decision Pinning**: Critical logical foundations are tagged and "pinned" to prevent context flushing during long missions.
- **Persistence**: State is hydrated/dehydrated via the Supermemory persistence layer.

## 👻 Stealth Ghosting (Microwave Mode)
- **Concurrency**: Leverages background sub-processes for non-blocking task execution.
- **Ephemeral Workers**: Scripts are provisioned in memory, executed, and scrubbed post-completion.
- **Throughput**: Optimized for O(n) file operations across massive repository structures.

## 🔗 Universal Bridge Protocol
- **Discovery**: Automatically identifies undocumented API hooks in bridged MCP servers.
- **Orchestration**: Uses topological sorting to resolve dependencies between hierarchical agent teams.
