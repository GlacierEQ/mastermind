# 🌌 Omni_Engine: Universal AI Orchestration OS
**Version**: 1.0.0-MAX | **Build**: Hardened | **State**: Overclocked (105%)

Omni_Engine is a high-velocity orchestration framework designed to unify disparate MCP servers, autonomous agents, and repository operation protocols into a single, cohesive intelligence layer.

## 🏗️ Core Architectural Layers

### 🧠 Orchestration (The Brain)
*   **AI Cognitive Nexus**: Multi-agent team grouping & hierarchical command.
*   **GitHub Nexus**: Cross-repo synchronization and production deployment.
*   **Quantum Context**: Semantic compression logic for infinite-reasoning loops.

### ⚔️ Operations (The Muscle)
*   **Mastermind Protocol**: A suite of 9 specialized agents (Forensics, Legal, Security, etc.).
*   **Super-Agent Orchestrator**: The autonomous entry point for full-loop repo management.
*   **Repo Operator 2.0**: Automated analysis, completion, and validation protocol.

### 🛠️ Meta-Forge (The Evolution)
*   **Universal Skill Factory**: Dynamically provisions new capabilities on-demand.
*   **Universal MCP Factory**: Bridges any OpenAPI spec into a functional MCP server.

### ⚡ Speed (The Microwave)
*   **Stealth Ghosting**: Low-footprint, high-throughput execution core.
*   **Microwave Mode**: Parallelized background processing for audits and security.

## 🛡️ Security & Zero-Trust
The Omni_Engine implements **Strict Redaction Protocols**. All logs and commits are automatically scrubbed of sensitive tokens (Perplexity, OpenAI, etc.) before reaching the persistent layer.
