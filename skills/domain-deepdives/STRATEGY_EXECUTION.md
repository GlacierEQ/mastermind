2. **Competitors:** Who are direct competitors? What's our advantage?
3. **New Entrants:** How easy to enter? What barriers exist?
4. **Substitutes:** What alternatives solve the same problem?
5. **Buyers:** How much power do customers have?

## 📊 OKR Implementation {#okr-implementation}

### OKR Structure

**Objectives:** Qualitative, inspirational goals
**Key Results:** Quantitative measures of success

```
OBJECTIVE: "Become the #1 customer-loved platform in our category"

KEY RESULTS:
1. Achieve 45 NPS score (from 35)
2. Reach 90% customer retention rate
3. Get 1000 organic referrals per month
```

### OKR Best Practices

**Grading Scale:**
```
0.7-1.0 = Green (Success)
0.4-0.6 = Yellow (Partial success)
0.0-0.3 = Red (Missed target)

Healthy: Average 0.6-0.7 across all OKRs
Too aggressive = 0.4
Too easy = 0.9
```

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- ❌ Creating 20+ OKRs (focus on 3-5)
- ❌ Making them too easy (should be ambitious)
- ❌ Confusing OKRs with projects
- ❌ Not aligning team OKRs with company OKRs
- ❌ Setting them and forgetting them

### Quarterly OKR Cycle

├─ Identify themes & focus areas
├─ Draft company OKRs
└─ Share for feedback

Week 3: Team Alignment

├─ Teams propose their OKRs
├─ Ensure alignment
└─ Lock OKRs

Weeks 4-13: Execution & Tracking

├─ Mid-quarter review (week 6)
├─ Adjust if needed (but rare)
└─ Track progress

Week 14: Retrospective
├─ Grade OKRs
├─ Identify learnings
├─ Plan next quarter

```

### Roadmap Prioritization Framework

**RICE Scoring:**
```
Priority Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

Example:
AI Chatbot:
- Reach: 10,000 users/month = 10
- Impact: High (10x = 3)
- Confidence: 80% = 0.8
- Effort: 6 weeks = 6
- Score: (10 × 3 × 0.8) / 6 = 4.0

Mobile App:
- Reach: 50,000 users/month = 50
- Impact: High (10x = 3)
- Confidence: 60% = 0.6
- Effort: 12 weeks = 12
- Score: (50 × 3 × 0.6) / 12 = 7.5 ✅ Higher priority

## 📈 Growth Strategies {#growth-strategies}

### Growth Framework: AARRR Metrics

```
ACQUISITION: How do users find us?
├─ Marketing channels
├─ CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)
└─ CPA (Cost Per Acquisition)
         ↓
ACTIVATION: Do they have good first experience?
├─ Onboarding flow
├─ Aha! moment
└─ Activation rate
         ↓
RETENTION: Do they keep coming back?
├─ Daily/Monthly Active Users
├─ Churn rate
└─ Habit formation
         ↓
REVENUE: How do we monetize?
├─ Average Revenue Per User
├─ Pricing model
└─ LTV (Lifetime Value)
         ↓
REFERRAL: Do they tell their friends?
├─ Viral coefficient
├─ NPS score
└─ Referral rate
```

### Viral Growth Mechanics

**Viral Coefficient (k):**
```
If k = 2.0: Each user refers 2 new users
Day 1: 1 user
Day 2: 3 users (1 + 2)
Day 3: 7 users (3 + 6)
Day 4: 15 users (exponential growth!)

If k = 0.5: Each user refers 0.5 users
Slower growth, but still healthy with good retention
```

**Viral Loops:**
```
1. PRIMARY LOOP (built into product)
   User action → Invite friend → Friend joins → Loop repeats
   Example: Dropbox referral bonus

2. SECONDARY LOOP (encouragement)
   Notification → "Share with team" → New users → Engagement
   Example: Slack channel invitations

3. CONTENT LOOP (organic discovery)
   User creates content → Content shared → Organic reach
   Example: YouTube videos shared on social media
```
