# Stealth & Microwave Operations
High-velocity, low-footprint execution modes for autonomous agents and CLI workflows.

## 🥷 Stealth Mode (Low-Noise)
Operate with minimal system impact and zero UI friction.
- **Background Execution**: Runs tasks in detached sessions.
- **Silent Logging**: Redirects all non-critical output to hidden logs.
- **Ephemeral Workspaces**: Uses RAM-disks or temp folders for intermediate files.
- **Footprint Reduction**: Automatic cleanup of shell history and temp artifacts.

## ☢️ Microwave Mode (High-Velocity)
Accelerated task completion by bypassing standard verification loops.
- **One-Shot Execution**: Direct implementation without preliminary scanning.
- **Parallel Processing**: Simultaneous execution of build, test, and deploy steps.
- **Pre-emptive Scripting**: Generates entire batches of files in a single write operation.
- **Fast-Track Validation**: Uses heuristic checks instead of exhaustive test suites.

## Integration
Compatible with Cline, Termux, and Repo Operator Protocol.
