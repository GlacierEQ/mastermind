## 🎯 DECISION FRAMEWORK

At each gate, decision logic:

### Gate 1: End of Phase 1 (PMF)
```
QUESTION: Does product-market fit exist?

YES (metrics hit):
├─ SHIP to public (move to CAC machine)

MAYBE (partial metrics):
├─ Iterate 2 more weeks
├─ Fix retention or NPS issues
├─ Then make hard go/no-go call

NO (metrics missed):
├─ PIVOT to new segment or problem
├─ Restart PMF cycle with new hypothesis
```

### Gate 2: End of Phase 2 (CAC)
```
QUESTION: Can we acquire customers profitably at scale?

YES (CAC < 3x LTV, 5000+ leads/month):
├─ SCALE acquisition spending
├─ Move to revenue optimization

MAYBE (CAC 2-3x LTV, 2000-5000 leads/month):
├─ OPTIMIZE channels (improve conversion)
├─ Improve product (increase LTV)
├─ Then reassess

NO (CAC > 4x LTV, <1000 leads/month):
├─ FIX unit economics
├─ Try different channels
├─ Or pivot to different segment
```

### Gate 3: End of Phase 3 (Revenue)
```
QUESTION: Are we extracting maximum value per customer?

YES (2-3x revenue multiplier achieved):
├─ SCALE with reinvested profit
├─ Move to team scaling

MAYBE (1.5-2x multiplier):
├─ Further optimize pricing/conversion
├─ Build additional monetization
└─ Then scale team

NO (<1.5x multiplier):
├─ Diagnose: Pricing? Conversion? Retention?
├─ Fix before scaling team
```

### Gate 4: End of Phase 4 (Team)
```
QUESTION: Can we sustain and scale this?

YES (90%+ retention, 40% velocity gain):
├─ SCALE to 50+ people
├─ Raise capital if desired
