## ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

❌ **DON'T:** Try to master all 50 skills at once
✅ **DO:** Pick 3 and go deep

❌ **DON'T:** Skip the forensics (just seems like extra work)
✅ **DO:** Spend 5 min post-execution - it compounds monthly

❌ **DON'T:** Learn without applying
✅ **DO:** Read → Apply → Track → Optimize (the cycle)

❌ **DON'T:** Ignore powerups
✅ **DO:** Every powerup = 2-20x multiplier, pick 2-3 to stack

❌ **DON'T:** Work alone
✅ **DO:** Share learnings, teach teammates, scale impact
