\section*{MOTION FOR SANCTIONS AGAINST SCOT STUART BROWER}

Plaintiff CASEY BARTON, Pro Se, respectfully moves this Court for an order imposing sanctions against Defendant's counsel, Scot Stuart Brower, pursuant to \textbf{Rule 11} of the Hawaiʻi Rules of Civil Procedure and the \textbf{Hawaiʻi Family Court Rules (HFCR)}.

\subsection*{I. GROUNDS FOR SANCTIONS}
Counsel has engaged in a consistent pattern of bad faith litigation, including but not limited to:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Rule 58 Violations}: Submitting proposed orders with multiple material errors and misspellings of the presiding judge's name, indicating a reckless disregard for procedural accuracy.
    \item \textbf{Strategic Delay}: Failing to submit required paperwork for over 12 months, effectively stalling proceedings to the detriment of the minor child.
    \item \textbf{Bad Faith Coordination}: Coordinated denial of parental visitation requests as documented in audio recordings from February 27, 2025.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{II. CONCLUSION}
Such conduct serves no purpose other than to harass the Plaintiff and deplete the resources of this Court.
