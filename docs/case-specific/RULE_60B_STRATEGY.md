## 🏛️ I. PROCEDURAL DEFECTS (The "Void" Logic)
The default judgment entered on June 24, 2025, is procedurally defective and violates Plaintiff's 14th Amendment Right to Due Process.

1. **Lack of Proper Notice**: Plaintiff was not served with the notice of the June 19, 2025, hearing that led to the default.
2. **HFCR 55(b)(2) Violation**: No three-day written notice of the application for default judgment was provided to the Pro Se Plaintiff.
3. **Custody without Evaluation**: The court awarded sole custody without the mandatory psychological evaluation, violating the "Best Interests of the Child" standard.
4. **Administrative Overreach**: The CSEA order was issued without a hearing, bypassing judicial oversight.

- **JK v. DK (HI 2023)**: Hawaii Supreme Court reversed a default denial where the warning was inadequate and the party was unrepresented.
- **BDM v. Sageco, 57 Haw. 73 (1976)**: Establishes the three-prong test for vacating default:
  - (1) Whether the non-defaulting party will be prejudiced.
  - (2) Whether the defaulting party has a meritorious defense.
  - (3) Whether the default was due to inexcusable neglect.
