\section*{PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS}

Petitioner CASEY BARTON respectfully petitions this Honorable Court for a Writ of Mandamus directing Respondent Judge Courtney Naso to issue a ruling on Petitioner's Motion for Pre-Decree Relief and Motion to Compel, which have been stalled for over 120 days.

\subsection*{I. JURISDICTION}
This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to \textbf{HRS § 602-5(4)} and \textbf{Rule 21} of the Hawaiʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure.

\subsection*{II. BASIS FOR RELIEF}
Mandamus is appropriate where a judge fails to perform a clear legal duty. The Family Court's mission is to provide a "fair, speedy, and economical" resolution. The current 4+ month delay in a matter involving child custody (\textit{Kekoa}) constitutes **Procedural Starvation** and a gross abuse of discretion.
