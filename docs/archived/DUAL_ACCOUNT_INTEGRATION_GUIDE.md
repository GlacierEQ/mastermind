# DUAL ACCOUNT INTEGRATION - THREE MEMORY SYSTEMS

## ACCOUNT STRUCTURE IDENTIFIED

### Memory Layer Discovery
From Supermemory vault search, confirmed:

**Account Assets Located In:**
- ✅ Google Keep PDF (Master Secret Vault)
- ✅ Google Drive (Primary Intelligence Vault)  
- ✅ .vault file (Protected by Entropy Shield Protocol)
- ✅ Mem0 Organization credentials
- ✅ Supermemory API keys
- ✅ Memory Plugin credentials

---

## WHAT'S IN THE VAULT

### Confirmed Credentials Indexed:
- ✅ Primary Mem0 API key
- ✅ Secondary Mem0 API key
- ✅ Supermemory SSE URLs (user-specific)
- ✅ Memory Plugin primary key
- ✅ Memory Plugin secondary key
- ✅ Mem0 Organization Name/ID
- ✅ Multiple API tokens for ecosystem

### Security Protocol:
- Vault Protocol ✅
- Entropy Shield Protocol ✅
- Auto-ingestion ready ✅

---

## YOUR TWO ACCOUNTS

Based on memory architecture discovered:

### Account 1: PRIMARY
- Email: glacier.equilibrium@gmail.com (OPERATOR)
- Role: Primary operational account
- Status: ✅ Currently active
- Systems: All three MCPs

### Account 2: SECONDARY / WORKSPACE CORE
- Type: Mem0 Pro / Secondary workspace
- Role: High-performance short-term workspace (Dual-Hemisphere Protocol)
- Status: ⏳ Need to retrieve credentials from vault
- Systems: All three MCPs

---

## RETRIEVAL PROCESS

To get your two accounts into all three MCPs:

### Step 1: Retrieve Vault Credentials
Location: Google Keep PDF or Google Drive vault

Need to extract:
- [ ] Second account email/ID
- [ ] Supermemory SSE URL (secondary)
- [ ] Mem0 API key (secondary)
- [ ] Mem0 Organization ID
- [ ] Memory Plugin token (secondary)
- [ ] Any other workspace-specific credentials

### Step 2: Current Status Check
```bash
# Check current account
mcp supermemory whoAmI '{}'
# Returns: glacier.equilibrium@gmail.com (OPERATOR)

# Check Mem0
mcp mem0ai-mem0-memory-mcp list_entities '{"user_id":"OPERATOR"}'

# Check Memory Plugin
mcp memoryplugin list_buckets '{}'
```

### Step 3: Dual-Account Strategy
Once credentials retrieved, implement:

**Option A: Parallel Accounts (Separate)**
- Account 1: Strategic vault (long-term, Supermemory)
- Account 2: Session workspace (short-term, Mem0)
- Both in Memory Plugin

**Option B: Synchronized (Mirrored)**
- Both accounts sync same data
- Cross-redundancy
- Backup capability

**Option C: Role-Based (Specialized)**
- Account 1: Case data (Kekoa TRO focus)
- Account 2: System operations (infrastructure)

## INTEGRATION COMMANDS (Ready to Use)

### Once Credentials Retrieved:

**Add Second Account to Supermemory:**
```bash
mcp supermemory addMemory '{
  "thingToRemember":"[Fact]",
  "projectId":"REDACTED_SM_kekoa_"
}'
# Will need to authenticate with secondary account first
```

**Add Second Account to Mem0:**
```bash
mcp mem0ai-mem0-memory-mcp add_memory '{
  "memory":"[Fact]",
  "user_id":"[SECONDARY_USER_ID]"
}'
```

**Add Second Account to Memory Plugin:**
```bash
mcp memoryplugin create_bucket '{
  "bucket":"[Account2_Bucket]"
}'
```

## ACTION ITEMS

### IMMEDIATE (Next 5 minutes):

1. **Locate vault credentials:**
   - Open Google Keep PDF with vault
   - Or access Google Drive vault folder
   - Find: Secondary account identifiers

2. **Identify second account:**
   - Email/username for Account 2
   - Mem0 Pro workspace details
   - API keys for secondary access

3. **Document credentials:**
   ```
   ACCOUNT 1 (PRIMARY):
   Email: glacier.equilibrium@gmail.com
   Status: ✅ Active
   
   ACCOUNT 2 (SECONDARY):
   Email/ID: [RETRIEVE FROM VAULT]
   Type: [Mem0 Pro / Workspace Core]
   Status: ⏳ Awaiting activation
   ```

### THEN (After credentials retrieved):

1. Update MCP configurations with both accounts
2. Test authentication on all three systems
3. Verify projects/buckets accessible from both
4. Implement sync strategy (parallel/mirror/role-based)
5. Begin dual-account case deployment

---

## MEMORY ARCHITECTURE CONFIRMATION

**Dual-Hemisphere Memory Protocol:**
- Hemisphere 1 (Short-term): Mem0 / Workspace Core / Session Access
- Hemisphere 2 (Long-term): Supermemory / Strategic Vault / Persistent

**Both hemispheres need both accounts for:**
- Redundancy
- Parallel processing
- Cross-verification
- Backup capability

---

## NEXT STEP

**👉 Go to your vault (Google Keep PDF or Google Drive) and retrieve:**
1. Secondary account credentials
2. API keys for second account
3. Mem0 Organization details
4. Supermemory SSE URL for second account
5. Memory Plugin secondary token

Then provide those details and I'll:
- Configure both accounts in all three MCPs
- Test dual-account connectivity
- Implement your preferred sync strategy
- Begin dual-account case deployment

---

## MEMORY VAULT LOCATIONS

### Primary Sources:
- **Google Keep**: Master secret vault (PDF format)
- **Google Drive**: Primary Intelligence Vault (10TB+)
- **.vault file**: Entropy Shield protected credentials
- **GitHub**: Version-controlled credentials (federated)

### Access Protocol:
Protected by Entropy Shield Protocol - credentials auto-ingested from encrypted layers

---

## DUAL-ACCOUNT BENEFITS

Once integrated:
✅ Parallel processing (Account 1 + Account 2)
✅ Session persistence (Mem0 workspace)
✅ Strategic archival (Supermemory vault)
✅ Cross-redundancy
✅ Backup capability
✅ Specialized role assignment
✅ Improved pattern discovery
✅ Enhanced security

---

## TIMELINE

- **Now**: Retrieve credentials from vault (5-10 min)
- **Today**: Configure both accounts (15-30 min)
- **This week**: Full dual-account deployment (2-3 hours)
