## 💡 KEY OPERATIONAL PATTERNS

### Expertise Domains
- Legal case automation and workflow streamlining
- ITSM (IT Service Management) processes
- Case-based environment optimization
- AI agent swarm coordination

### Methodology
1. **Decomposition:** Break complex tasks into specialized agent tasks
2. **Parallelization:** Execute multiple agents simultaneously
3. **Interlinked Findings:** Connect results across agents
4. **State Management:** Maintain version-controlled work state
5. **Continuous Execution:** Autonomous 24/7 operational processes

### Foundational Blueprint
- **Ultimate MCP Schema for High-Priority Operations (v1.0)** - architectural foundation
- Hierarchical project structure with semantic organization
- Multi-layer data categorization:
  - **SYSTEM:** Identity, Architecture, Cognition
  - **PROTOCOLS:** Legal, Operational frameworks
  - **OPERATIONAL_HISTORY:** Failures, Audits, learning
  - **VAULT:** Credentials & access management

## 📈 CONTEXT IMPLICATIONS

### For AI Assistance
1. **Deep Context Needed:** Legal complexity + technical infrastructure requires comprehensive briefing
2. **Project Context:** Always identify relevant project(s) for task routing
3. **Autonomy Required:** AI should assume permission for parallel execution within defined protocols
4. **State Management:** All work should be version-controlled and logged
5. **Integration Points:** Leverage GitHub, Google Workspace, n8n for execution

### Operational Priorities
- Legal case automation (Kekoa TRO focus)
- Systemic operations coordination
- Memory/knowledge management
- Administrative entity management
- Evidence documentation and retrieval

## 🚀 RECOMMENDED CONTEXT ENGAGEMENT

When assisting, consider:
- ✅ Reference relevant project tags automatically
- ✅ Integrate with existing MCPs (search, automation, memory)
- ✅ Maintain version control for deliverables
- ✅ Use agent swarm methodology for complex tasks
- ✅ Document in memory for future reference
- ✅ Cross-reference legal/technical precedents
